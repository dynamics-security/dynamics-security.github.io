	<strong>2021 Call for Submissions</strong> 
</p>
<p>
	<strong>About the DYNAMICS Workshop</strong> 
</p>
<p>
	The 2021 DYnamic and Novel Advances in Machine Learning and Intelligent Cyber Security (DYNAMICS) Workshop will be held virtually on Monday, December 10<sup>th</sup>, 2021. The workshop will be co-located with the 2021 <a href="https://www.acsac.org/"> Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)</a>, held virtually. 
</p>
<p>
	Machine learning has become critical to the evolution and sustainability of cybersecurity. While the theoretical objectives and principles behind cybersecurity are still valid, traditional technologies that require humans in the loop to read log files, triage alerts, and harden devices are neither fast enough nor scalable enough to meet the demands of modern networks and attacks. While network traffic and devices have grown by orders of magnitude, the ability for operators to triage the resulting alerts has not. <br />
	<br />
	The sophistication of threats has also increased substantially. Sophisticated zero-day attacks go undetected for months at a time. Attacks take place over extended periods, effectively outwaiting traditional intrusion detection technology. Worse, new attack tools and strategies can now be developed using adversarial machine learning techniques, requiring rapid co-evolution of defenses that match the speed and sophistication of machine learning-based offensive techniques. <br />
	<br />
	This is intended to focus on novel applied and theoretical work that combines machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial machine learning, and deep learning with significant problems in cybersecurity. We consider both offensive and defensive applications of machine learning to security.

		<strong>Technical Paper Submissions </strong> 
	</p>
	<p>
		The DYNAMICS Workshop invites submissions of original, previously unpublished technical papers, posters, and panels on research in machine learning and cybersecurity. Papers should be between 5 and 12 pages, and should use the 2021 ACM Proceedings Template: <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"> https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>, using the [sigconf, anonymous] options. Submissions will be evaluated using a standard peer review process. While authors may wish to align their submissions with one of the suggested topics below, submissions on other topics related to the workshop theme are welcome. Papers should emailed at <a href="mailto:dynamics.submissions@gmail.com"> dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a>.
