<p><strong>About the DYNAMICS Workshop</strong></p>
<p>The 2020 DYnamic and Novel Advances in Machine Learning and Intelligent Cyber Security (DYNAMICS) Workshop will be held on Monday, December 7 <sup>th</sup>. The workshop will be co-located with the 2020 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), held at the AT&amp;T Hotel and Conference Center in Austin, Texas. Due to the evolving COVID situation, DYNAMICS will be held virtually.</p>
<p>Machine learning has become critical to the evolution and sustainability of cybersecurity. While the theoretical objectives and principles behind cybersecurity are still valid, traditional technologies that require humans in the loop to read log files, triage alerts, and harden devices are neither fast enough nor scalable enough to meet the demands of modern networks and attacks. While network traffic and devices have grown by orders of magnitude, the ability for operators to triage the resulting alerts has not. <br /> <br /> The sophistication of threats has also increased substantially. Sophisticated zero-day attacks go undetected for months at a time. Attacks take place over extended periods, effectively outwaiting traditional intrusion detection technology. Worse, new attack tools and strategies can now be developed using adversarial machine learning techniques, requiring rapid co-evolution of defenses that match the speed and sophistication of machine learning-based offensive techniques. <br /> <br /> This is intended to focus on novel applied and theoretical work that combines machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial machine learning, and deep learning with significant problems in cybersecurity. We consider both offensive and defensive applications of machine learning to security.</p>

<p><strong>Technical Paper Submissions </strong></p>
<p>The DYNAMICS Workshop invites submissions of original, previously unpublished technical papers, posters, and panels on research in machine learning and cybersecurity. Papers should be between 5 and 12 pages, and should use the 2020 ACM Proceedings Template: <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"> https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template </a> , using the [sigconf, anonymous] options. Submissions will be evaluated using a standard peer review process. While authors may wish to align their submissions with one of the suggested topics below, submissions on other topics related to the workshop theme are welcome. Papers should emailed at <a href="mailto:dynamics.submissions@gmail.com"> dynamics.submissions@gmail.com </a> .</p>

<div>
<p><strong>DYNAMICS Forums</strong></p>
<p>A DYNAMICS Forum is a 1-2 hour extended discussion on a specific topic of interest to the DYNAMICS machine learning and cyber security community. A forum may focus on a specific technical problem, a policy issue, a social concern, or another DYNAMICS-related topic that you believe should be explored in depth. The intent of the forum format is to bring together a community that will not only explore your topic deeply within the context of the DYNAMICS Workshop itself, but that will have the potential to persist and grow beyond the workshop, in order to develop collaborative solutions over the long term. A DYNAMICS Forum is led by one or more moderators, who facilitate a discussion with a fully engaged audience.</p>
<p>If you would like to submit a DYNAMICS Forum proposal, please send an abstract of no more than 2 pages to <a href="mailto:dynamics@acsac.org">dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a>. Please be sure to include your proposed topic, moderators, a statement of why your idea is relevant and important to the DYNAMICS community, proposed length, and a high-level outline with your major discussion topics. Your submission will be evaluated for inclusion in the workshop based on its relevance to the workshop theme, the quality of the submission, and the availability of space in the workshop schedule. While proposed topics may be aligned with one of the suggested topics below, submissions on other topics related to the workshop theme are welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Panels</strong></p>
<p>Panel submissions are invited on topics of interest to the DYNAMICS machine learning and cyber security community. To submit a panel, please send an abstract of up to 1 page to <a href="mailto:dynamics@acsac.org">dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a>. Please be sure to include your proposed topic, panelists, panel chair, affiliations, and position statements for each panelist. DYNAMICS panels follow the same format as those of the main ACSAC conference. Extensive information about ACSAC&rsquo;s panel requirements can be found at <a href="https://www.acsac.org/2020/submissions/panels/"> https://www.acsac.org/2020/submissions/panels/ </a> .</p>
<p><strong>Posters</strong></p>
<p>Poster submissions are invited on topics of interest to the DYNAMICS machine learning and cyber security community. Posters provide a way for workshop attendees to present early stage, ongoing research that is not yet ready for submission as a peer reviewed paper, Poster presenters also gain feedback from conference and workshop attendees, and spark discussion among conference and workshop participants. Poster dimensions can be up to 36&times;48 inches (91x122 cm). Poster abstracts are not peer reviewed. Accepted abstracts will be made available on the workshop website prior to the event, but they will not be included in the workshop proceedings. To submit a poster, submit an e-mail with a PDF of your draft poster to <a href="mailto:dynamics@acsac.org">dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a>. For questions on posters, please contact <a href="mailto:dynamics@acsac.org">dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Talks</strong></p>
<p>A Lightning Talk is timed, 5-minute talk on a topic of interest to the DYNAMICS machine learning and cyber security community. While lightning talks may be given on works in progress, or other topics of relevance to the workshop, you can even use a lightning talk to ask a question, find a community of shared interest on a topic, engage people in an issue, ask a question, or solicit feedback! A good lightning talk is fast paced, engaging, and high energy, and can use any desired presentation format.</p>
<p>Note that although Lightning Talk abstracts are reviewed by the DYNAMICS Workshop committee for relevance, they are not peer reviewed, and will not appear in the workshop proceedings. To submit a Lightning Talk, please e-mail your proposed topic to <a href="mailto:dynamics@acsac.org">dynamics.submissions@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Publication </strong></p>
<p>Papers that have been accepted by the DYNAMICS workshop will be published in the workshop proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Requirements</strong></p>
<p>By submitting a paper, DYNAMICS Forum, poster, panel, or lightning talk to the DYNAMICS workshop, you agree that if your submission is accepted, one or more of the submission&rsquo;s authors will present the final version of the submission at the workshop.</p>
